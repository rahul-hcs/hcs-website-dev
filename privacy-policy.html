					<h2>Privacy Policy for our web sites</h2>
					<p>When you browse any website you leave behind a trail of data about what pages you visit and how
						long you spend
						on them. This data is often collected by website managers using analytics systems to get a
						better idea of how
						people interact with their site and to perform improvements in their site.</p>
					<p>Honeycomb Solutions uses Google Analytics in order to gather detailed anonymous statistics about
						the website's
						traffic, along with the system's and user’s behavior. Google Analytics stores information about
						what pages you
						visit, how long you are on the site, how you got here and what you click on. This Analytics data
						is collected
						via a JavaScript tag in the pages of our site and is not tied to personally identifiable
						information. Following
						the Google Analytics terms of service, we do not track, collect or upload any personally
						identifiable
						information about an individual (such as your name or email). The anonymous non-PII data
						collected is used for
						statistical purposes only, including: <ul>
							<li>To find out how many people are visiting our sites</li>
							<li>To identify what pages are accessed more frequently</li>
							<li>To help us evaluate the information we are supplying to our users and continue improving
								it</li>
							<li>To make our site more user friendly</li>
							<li>To understand what people learn about science from visiting such websites, and how we
								might improve the
								learning experience in future.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>Additionally, we use the demographic and interest information feature in Google Analytics. This
						provides us
						with statistics about the age, gender, location and interests of users. By using this
						information we aim to
						characterize the common user profile behind user participation and make sure that learners from
						all ages,
						genders and nationalities have the opportunity to receive consistent, relevant and useful
						information from our
						apps.</p>

					<p>Third Party cookies are set on your machine by external websites whose services are used on this
						site. Cookies
						of this type are the sharing buttons across the site allowing visitors to share content onto
						social networks.
						Cookies are currently set by Twitter and Facebook. In order to implement these buttons and
						connect them to the
						relevant social networks and external sites, there are scripts from domains outside of our
						website. You should
						check the respective policies of each of these sites to see how exactly they use your
						information and to find
						out how to opt out, or delete, such information.</p>
					<h3>Opt-out of website analytics data gathering</h3>

						that browser. If
						you block all third-party cookies from being set on your browser, you may not be able to enjoy
						some features or
						functionality of certain websites. You may also install the Google Analytics browser opt-out
						add-on to prevent
						(non-PII) data being sent to Google Analytics. In either case, however, we shall not collect any
						PII as set
						forth above.</p>
					<h3>Other</h3>
					<p>We may also ask you some questions via pop-up surveys, polls or similar tools. Any personal
						information that you
						volunteer when you visit our website or our Facebook page will be treated with the highest
						standard of security
						and confidentiality. Information collected via these surveys is stored locally, not shared with
						third parties,

					<h3>Update info</h3>
					<p>This privacy policy was last updated on May 02, 2019. Our privacy policy may change from time to
						time. If we
						make any material changes to our policy, we will place a prominent notice on our website or
						application.</p>
